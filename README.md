# Unity-Mobile-Game---Traffic
Combination of the puzzle game Rush Hour the and app Don't Touch The White Tile.

In the puzzle game Rush Hour the player had to guide a car through a traffic jam, only able to move cars backwards and forwards 
on a grind. This game takes that mechanic and places one puzzle after another, the player has no control over their car which is 
moving up through the middle gaining speed the further it traveles.
